# Automation test framework

Vu Do - Assessment

  * UI Functional Test - Web Application - Online Calculator

### Technical

Programing language: Java

This framework uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Cucumber] - BDD style support for testing on Java!
* [JUnit 4&5] - Test runner tool of Java
* [Selenium] - Library use for interacting with Web Browser.
* [WebDriverManager] - Controlling the driver for each browser in the machine
* [AssertJ] - Fluent assertions for java
* [OCRSpace] - Free Online OCR - Convert images and PDF to text - Free OCR API (get numbers from the image of result bar)

### Installation

Pull the code via git command to your local:
```
git clone https://github.com/dovuqc/dovuqc.git
```
Ensure JDK 1.8 and Maven has been installed
```
brew install maven
```

### Running

**For Cucumber Test**

Run all test scenarios for addition, subtraction & division of Online Calculator Application

```sh
$ mvn clean test
```
or run specific scenarios with tags

```sh
$ mvn clean test "-Dcucumber.options=--tags \"[tagName]\""
```
[tagName] = @ tag name  e.g. @addition, @subtraction, @division...

### Structure
**MAIN**

`main.java.pages`: contains **Page Object Class** of Online Calculator web application page

`main.java.utils`: contains all **Utilities Classes**, such as ImageReader (ORC), WebHelper...

`main.java.driver`: contains the **DriverManager Class** manage the ChromeDriver & configurations

**TEST**

`test.java.stepdefs`: where define **Methods of Cucumber Gherkin steps** https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/step-definitions/. - Cucumber step definitions

`test.java.tests`: contains test classes - Cucumber Running Class - `RunCucumberTest` with JUnit

`test.java.resources:` The directory `features` stores all **Test Scenarios**.

**Pom.xml**: It is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project. It contains default values for most projects (plugins, dependencies/libraries, and properties, profile, environment variables... if any)

### Test Report
The Cucumber test report will be generated by using report plugin and defined at @CucumberOptions in `step_defs.RunCucumberTest`

All test results should be stored as screenshots - PNG files in `target/actual-result` folder.
